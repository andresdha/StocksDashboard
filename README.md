# Stock Closing Price Dashboard

This a very **simple** interactive dashboard displaying historical closing prices for dyferent symbols.

It has a Symbol selector (supports multiple symbols at once) and a Date Picker.

Stock info is retreived using the [Tiingo API][tiingo].

Improvements on this Dashboard will depend on how it evolves and on availability of time.

This is a personal project for fun and for improving dashboard skills.
